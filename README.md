Story:

Main is a scientist in Earth1, who is researching technology which can manipulate the very fabric of space time inside of his lab.
Main creates a rip in the fabric, and is sucked in, which takes him to Earth2 inside of a large spaceship.
Unbeknownst to Main, he is sucked in as a result of Alternate Main, who is trying to help Earth2 invade Earth1 and use it for resources. Alternate Main was unable to figure out the method of a portal, but was able to figure out how to bring Earth1 people to Earth2, and as so brought Main to help him
Upon arriving to Earth2, Main is arrested and taken to a holding cell, where he meets Lancer and Scientist
Here, Main talks to Lancer and Scientist and learns that the people of Earth2 are very utilitarian, and that the goals of Earth2 are to take over Earth1 and use it for resources. 
The Scientistâ€™s personality is somewhat like this, but only truly cares about the advancement of science.
Main also learns that Lancer disliked this utilitarian quality about herself, and so requested that Scientist give her more emotional thinking, which he obliged to do. This made Lancer less effective as a General, which made her and the Scientist get arrested.
Main breaks out Scientist and Lancer from the holding cell, and as a display of gratitude, Lancer agrees to join you. 
The Scientist, in typical neutral fashion, simply wants to advance science by modifying and improving the Earth1 Gravity Gun which Main brings along with him using Earth2 technology, so agrees to help Main stop Earth2 if he brings back parts to improve the Gun.
The Main utilizes the Gravity Gun (which improves over time), to clear the Earth2 Ship
Once we get to the final enemy on earth 2, the final enemy tries to convince Lancer character to come to his side. Lancer character agrees and turns on MC.
Finally, as Main returns to the Portal Room, he sees Alternate Main boot up the Portal which would allow the people of Earth2 to take over, and so fights Alternate Main and, with great sadness, is forced to destroy the portal which could take him home for the sake of Earth1.
